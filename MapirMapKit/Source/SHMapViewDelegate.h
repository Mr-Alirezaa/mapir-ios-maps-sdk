/// the `MGLMapView` class to load data asynchronously, the map view calls these
/// methods to notify your application when specific operations complete. The map
/// view also uses these methods to request information about annotations displayed
/// on the map, such as the styles and interaction modes to apply to individual
/// annotations.
